Here is a basic algorithm for generating exam papers:

Define the exam parameters such as subject, number of questions, difficulty level, and time limit.
Create a database of questions for the chosen subject that covers all relevant topics and subtopics.
Randomly select a set of questions from the database that meets the required number of questions, difficulty level, and time limit.
Group the questions into different sections, such as multiple choice, true/false, and short answer.
Arrange the questions in a logical order within each section, ensuring that the questions are well-balanced in terms of difficulty level.
Assign marks for each question based on its difficulty level and length.
Generate the exam paper by arranging the sections in a logical order and including any additional instructions or rules for the exam.
Review the generated exam paper to ensure that it meets the desired parameters and make any necessary adjustments.
This algorithm can be further optimized and customized based on the specific requirements and constraints of the exam.
